1:  You have to do the same using Shell Script i.e using either Loops or command with start day and end day variables using arguments -

#!/bin/bash

for (( i=1;i<=$2;i++))
do
        mkdir $1-$i
done

ls
2:  Create a Script to backup all your work done till now.
 #!/bin/bash

Backup_directory="/Users/wd-21121/Desktop/DevOps/*"
Backups="/Users/wd-21121/Desktop/backup"
date=$(date +"%d-%b-%Y")

mkdir $Backups/$date
cp -r $Backup_directory $Backups/$date

echo "Backup created in $Backups/$date"

3: Read About Cron and Crontab, to automate the backup Script:
 Cron is the system's main scheduler for running jobs or tasks unattended. A command called crontab allows the user to submit, 
 edit or delete entries to cron. A crontab file is a user file that holds the scheduling information.
 01 09 * * * bash/Users/wd-21121/Desktop/Day5/basckup.sh
 
4: Read about User Management: .
   User management is an organizational function that enables users to access and control digital assets, such as applications, devices, networks, and cloud services. 
   Organizations are now exploring even more advanced solutions.
5: Create 2 users and just display their Usernames: 
  sudo useradd Thakur
  sudo useradd Mohan
  sudo cat /etc/passwd
  sudo gpasswd Mohan
  awk -F':' '{ print $1}' /etc/passwd


  end
