## What is Shell Scripting for DevOps.
 
 Shell scripting is a way to automate tasks in a shell environment (e.g., bash). It involves writing scripts, which are essentially a series of commands that are executed in order. These scripts can be used to automate a wide variety of tasks, such as deploying software, building and testing applications, and managing systems. In the context of DevOps, shell scripting is often used to automate tasks related to continuous integration, continuous delivery, and infrastructure management.
 
 
 ## What is #!/bin/bash? can we write #!/bin/sh as well?
 
 #!/bin/bash is a shebang that tells the operating system to use the bash shell to interpret and execute the commands in a script.

Yes, you can also write #!/bin/sh as the shebang to use the Bourne shell to interpret and execute the commands in a script.
