Here is the day 4 summary of the #90DaysofDevops challenge
What is Kernel?
The kernel is a computer program that is the core of a computer's operating system, with complete control over everything in the system.

What is Shell?
A shell is a special user program that provides an interface for the user to use operating system services. 
Shell accepts human-readable commands from users and converts them into something which the kernel can understand. 
It is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from input devices such as keyboards or from files. 
The shell gets started when the user logs in or starts the terminal.

What is Linux Shell Scripting for DevOps?
Shell Scripting is a program to write a series of commands for the shell to execute. 
Shell is a command-line interpreter and Shell script is nothing but a list of commands executed by the shell. 
It can combine lengthy and repetitive sequences of commands into a single and simple script that can be stored and executed anytime which, reduces programming efforts.

What is #!/bin/bash?
#!/bin/bash is a shebang line used in script files to set bash, present in the '/bin' directory, as the default shell for executing commands present in the file.
"#!" is a shebang in the character sequence consisting of the character's number sign and exclamation mark ( #!) at the beginning of a script.

Can we write #!/bin/sh as well?
#!/bin/sh: It is used to execute the file using sh, which is a Bourne shell, or a compatible shell.
Just like that, we have #!/bin/csh. It is used to execute the file using csh, the C shell, or a compatible shell.

Write a Shell Script that prints "I will complete #90DaysofDeVops challenge"
-> echo "I will complete #90DaysofDevops challenge

Write a Shell Script to take user input, input from arguments, and print the variables.
->echo "what is you age:"
  read age
  echo "your age is $age"

Write an Example of If else in Shell Scripting by comparing two numbers
-> echo -n "enter the first number:"; read a
   echo -n "enter the second number:"; read b
  if ["$a" -lt "$b"]
  then 
  echo "a is smaller than b"
  else
  echo "b is smaller than a"

  if [ "$a" -eq "$b"]
  then
  echo " a and b are both same"

  fi
