Day 17 Task refer [Hashnode](https://sumitramchandra.hashnode.dev/docker-project-for-devops-engineers)
# Task
Create a Dockerfile for a simple web application (e.g. a Node.js or Python app)
Here, we are going to clone an open-source project and dockerize it.

Build the image using the Dockerfile and run the container
let's look at the Dockerfile first

Let's break down the above Dockerfile into its components:

FROM - sets the base image to use. In this case, we are using version 3.9 of python

WORKDIR - sets the working directory for the container to /app.

COPY - copies the application files into the container.

RUN - runs a command to install any dependencies needed. In this case, we are updating the package list and installing Python 3.

CMD - sets the command to run when the container starts.

Note that the instructions in a Dockerfile are executed in the order they are written. It is also important to use the correct syntax and formatting when writing a Dockerfile, as any mistakes can result in errors during the build process.

Now, after creating the Dockerfile, let's create the image using

sudo docker build . -t <tag>
Now run the docker image using

sudo docker run -d -p 8001:8001

here, -d means in the background (Daemon) mode and -p is used for port mapping. We have exposed our image to port 8001.

Verify that the application is working as expected by accessing it in a web browser
to verify the application is running copy your IP and paste it into the browser

along with the colon and respective port number (ex. http://xx.xxx.xx.xx:8001)

Push the image to a public or private repository (e.g. Docker Hub )

docker push <hub-user>/<repo-name>:<tag>
  
So, this is how you dockerize any open-source application and then publish it into your repository.
