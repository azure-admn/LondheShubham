### What is Scaling?

- Scaling is about making systems able to handle more work or users. There are two main types: vertical and horizontal.

- Vertical scaling means making one server or system bigger by adding more resources like memory or storage.

### What is Infrastructure?

- Infrastructure is all the hardware and software needed to support software development and deployment.

- It includes things like servers, networks, storage devices, and the tools used to manage them.

- By using automated tools and methods like Infrastructure as Code, companies can manage and scale their infrastructure more easily.

### Why is DevOps Important?
