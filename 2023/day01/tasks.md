## Introduction - Day 1

This is the day you have to Take this challenge and start your #90DaysOfDevOps with the #TrainWithShubham Community

- Fork this Repo= Done
- Start with a DevOps Roadmap[https://youtu.be/iOE9NTAG35g] = started

 - What is DevOps:
   Devops = Development + Operation
   Deveops is a software development approach through which superior quality software can be deveploped quickly with more reliability.
   Objective of Devops: To shorten the life cycle of System's Development.
   DevOps connects development, delivery, and operations and, thus, facilitates a fluid collaboration of these traditionally separated silos. 
   DevOps  is today used across industries and is not limited anymore to IT services and specific technologies.
   
 - What is Automation, Scaling, Infrastructure
 - Automation :
              "Automation means replacing manual operations with automatic ones. It can be applied at various levels within the organization". We can have DevOps without Automation (or processes and behaviors), but it won’t be effective. DevOps requires fast processing and fast testing. And this is where automation comes in – it empowers DevOps to support multiple projects and pipelines in a cost-effective way. It reduces the amount of overhead and human intervention in managing an application’s life cycle. It increases the speed and efficiency of configurations, but IT teams still need to validate the code and be accountable for mistakes and failures. Automating IT processes allows organizations to keep up with the rapid pace of innovation.
Automation Tools :
                     1.Docker
                     2.Kubernetes
                     3.Raygun
                     4.Splunk
                     5.Ansible
                     6.Jenkins
                     7.Bamboo
Scaling :
Scalability refers to the ability of the business to set up its systems to grow during times of high demand and scale back when demand decreases. The optimum    environment for achieving the appropriate level of scalability is DevOps, thanks to specific techniques. People can interact, concentrate on their work, have more creative alternatives, and swiftly deploy software through these techniques.Scaling in DevOps is characterized as an automation-driven environment where developers or enterprises can adopt DevOps culture and choose the right technologies to scale their business growth.
  
  Infrastructure:
  IT systems that can be formed by creating scripts or functions .Infrastructure as Code or IaC is the process of provisioning and
  managing  infrastructure defined through code, instead of doing so with a manual process.
  
 - Why DevOps is Important ?
 - DevOps promotes shorter, more controllable iterations through the adoption of best practices, automation and new tools
 - 1.Maximizes Efficiency with Automation:The most effective strategies for DevOps transformation focus on structural improvements that build community.
   DevOps emphasizes deploying software more often, in a reliable and secure way through automation.
   
   2.Improves Speed and Stability of Software Development and Deployment
   
   3.Faster, better product delivery
  
  4.Faster issue resolution and reduced complexity
  
  5.Greater scalability and availability
   
   6.More stable operating environments
  
  7.Better resource utilization
   
   8.Greater automation
   
   9.Greater visibility into system outcomes
   
   10.Greater innovation
