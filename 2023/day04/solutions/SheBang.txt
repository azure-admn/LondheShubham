 "#!/bin/bash" is called a shebang, and it is the first line of a shell script. It specifies the interpreter that should be
used to run the script. In this case, /bin/bash is the path to the bash interpreter.

"#!/bin/sh" can also be used as a shebang, and it is similar to #!/bin/bash. However, the sh interpreter is usually a symlink
to another shell interpreter such as bash, dash, ash or busybox, and its behavior may differ depending on the system. 
sh is considered to be a minimal POSIX shell, while bash is an extended shell with additional features. 
Some scripts are written specifically for sh, others for bash, and some are written to be compatible with both.

So, if you want to ensure that your script will run in any Unix-like system, you should use #!/bin/sh as it is 
more portable across different platforms. 
But if you want to take advantage of the extended features of bash, you should use #!/bin/bash.
