 **Tasks**

 - Explain in your own words and examples, what is Shell Scripting for DevOps.

Shell scripting for DevOps means set of instruction given by user which will use in process's like automation , installation , services etc.

 - What is `#!/bin/bash?` can we write `#!/bin/sh` as well?

`#!/bin/bash` is shebang , basically a interpreter for scripts .

yes we can write #!/bin/sh as it specifies the basic shell features does not required bash specific features.

 - Write a Shell Script which prints `I will complete #90DaysOofDevOps challenge`


#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter input" input
echo "$input"


 - Write a Shell Script to take user input, input from arguments and print the variables.

#!/bin/bash
read -p "value" value
arg_value=$1
echo "result : $value"
echo "arg_result : $arg_value"


 - Write an Example of If else in Shell Scripting by comparing 2 numbers

#!/bin/bash

read -p "value" value

if [ $value -gt $value2 ]

then echo "good"

else echo "not good"

fi
