This is my submission of Day 4

**Tasks**

 - Explain in your own words and examples, what is Shell Scripting for DevOps.

    Shells are interactive, they accept the command as an input from users and execute them. 
    Shell can also take commands from a file; we can write these desired commands in a file 
    and can easily execute them in shell to avoid repetitive work. Such files are called Shell Scripts 
    or also called Shell Programs.
    A shell script is a text file that contains a sequence of commands for a UNIX-based operating system. 
    It is called a shell script because it combines a sequence of commands, that would otherwise have to 
    be typed into the keyboard one at a time, into a single script.


 - What is `#!/bin/bash?` can we write `#!/bin/sh` as well?

    It defines an absolute path /usr/bin/bash to the Bash shell. This is usually the default 
    location of the Bash shell in almost all Unix-based operating systems. This shebang line is used 
    to execute commands with the Bash interpreter.
    Yes we can write '#!/bin/sh' as well, asically bash is sh, with more features and better syntax. 
    Most commands work the same.


 - Write a Shell Script which prints `I will complete #90DaysOofDevOps challenge`

    1. create a file with .sh extension. (like new.sh)
    2. open new.sh file in VI editor (vi new.sh)
    3. envoke the bash by writing '#!/bin/bash' command
    4. use 'echo' command to print the message to the terminal
 
 script:-
   -#!/bin/bash
   -echo "I will complete #90DaysOofDevOps challenge"
   
   {refer file new.sh}

 - Write a Shell Script to take user input, input from arguments and print the variables.

 script:-
    -#!/bin/bash
    #get user's name as input
    -echo "what is your name:"
    -read name

    #input from arguments
    -position=$1

    #print the variable
    -echo "name:$name"
    -echo "position:$position"
    
    {refer file input.sh}


 - Write an Example of If else in Shell Scripting by comparing 2 numbers

    script:-
    #!/bin/bash

num1=$1
num2=$2

if [ $num1 -gt $num2 ]
then
  echo "$num1 is greater than $num2"
else
  echo "$num2 is greater than $num1"
fi
