# Data Types and Data Structures in Python

Refer my article - [Hashnode](https://sumitramchandra.hashnode.dev/data-types-and-data-structures-in-python)

Tasks 1

Give the Difference between List, Tuple and set. Do Handson and put screenshots as per your understanding.

List, Tuple, and Set are three commonly used data structures in Python. Each of them has its unique features and use cases. Here are the differences between them:

List:

A list is a collection of ordered elements.

It is mutable, which means the elements in the list can be changed.

Lists are defined with square brackets [ ] and elements are separated by commas.

Example: list = [1, 2, 3, 'four', 'five']

Tuple:

A tuple is a collection of ordered elements.

It is immutable, which means that once created, the elements in the tuple cannot be changed.

Tuples are defined with parentheses () and elements are separated by commas.

Example: my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'four', 'five')

Set:

A set is an unordered collection of unique elements.

It is mutable, which means the elements in the set can be changed.

Sets are defined with curly braces {} or with the set() function.

Example: my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} or my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

In summary, the main differences between lists, tuples, and sets are their mutability, order, and uniqueness. Lists are mutable and ordered, tuples are immutable and ordered, and sets are mutable and unordered.

Task 2

Create the below Dictionary and use Dictionary methods to print your favorite tool just by using the keys of the Dictionary.

fav_tools = 
{ 
  1:"Linux", 
  2:"Git", 
  3:"Docker", 
  4:"Kubernetes", 
  5:"Terraform", 
  6:"Ansible", 
  7:"Chef"
}

Task 3

Create a List of cloud service providers eg.

cloud_providers = ["AWS","GCP","Azure"]

Write a program to add Digital Ocean to the list of cloud_providers and sort the list in alphabetical order.

[Hint: Use keys to built-in functions for Lists]
